"Like, I imagine, many of the other authors in this collection of essays I "
"started contributing to Free Software when I was a student. I had decided "
"relatively late in life to pursue a degree in Computer Science (having "
"failed to become rich and famous as a musician) and was expecting to be "
"quite a bit older than my peers when I graduated. So I thought it would be "
"good to teach myself programming, which I was not getting much of at school, "
"to become more attractive to future employers, despite my age.  After some "
"forays into various smaller communities I eventually found my way into KDE "
"and started working on the email application. Thanks to the extremely "
"helpful and technically brilliant group of people I met there I was able to "
"learn quickly and contribute meaningfully to the code base, getting sucked "
"more and more into both the social circle and the fascinating technical "
"problem space of personal information management."

"As things stand today it is still harder for IT operations people and "
"decision makers to use Free Software than it is to use proprietary "
"alternatives. Even in Germany, where Free Software has relatively strong "
"political backing, it is easier and safer to suggest the use of something "
"that is perceived as ``industry standard'' or ``what everyone else does''; "
"proprietary solutions, in other words.  Someone who proposes a Free Software "
"solution will likely face opposition by less adventurous (or more "
"short-sighted) colleagues, close scrutiny by superiors, higher expectations "
"with respect to the results and unrealistic budget pressure. It thus "
"requires a special breed of person willing to take personal risks, go out on "
"a limb, potentially jeopardize career progress and fight an uphill "
"battle. This is of course true in any organization, but in a public "
"administration special persistence is required because things move generally "

"As technologists, Free Software people tend to focus on the things that are "

"put less emphasis on things that are more important in the context of an "
"(often large) public administration. But consider someone wanting to roll "
"out a set of technologies in an organization that intends to stick with it "
"for a long time. Since disruptive change is difficult and expensive, it is "
"far more important to have documentation of the things that will not work, "
"so they can be avoided or worked around, than it is to know that some future "
"version will behave much better. It is unlikely that that new version will "
"ever be practically available to the users currently under consideration, "
"and it is far easier to deal with known issues pro-actively than to be "
"forced to react to surprises.  Today's documented bug is, ironically, often "

"In a large organization that uses software for a long time, the cost of "
"acquiring the software, be it via licenses or as part of contracted custom "
"development of Free Software, pales in comparison to the cost of maintaining "
"and supporting it.  This leads to the thinking that fewer, more stable "

"likely less mature bells and whistles."

"While both of these sentiments run counter to the instincts of Free Software "
"developers, it is these same aspects that make it very attractive for the "
"public sector to contract the development of Free Software, rather than "
"spending the money on licenses for off-the-shelf products. Starting from a "
"large pool of freely available software, the organization can invest the "
"budgets it has into maturing exactly those parts that are relevant for its "
"own operations. It thus does not have to pay (via license costs) for the "
"development of market driven, fancy features it will not need. By submitting "
"all of that work back upstream into the community, the longer term "
"maintenance of these improvements and of the base software is shared amongst "
"many. Additionally, because all of the improvements become publicly "
"available, other organizations with similar needs can benefit from them with "
"no additional cost, thus maximizing the impact of tax payer money, something "

"Historically, the key selling point of Free Software that has been "

"Software has indeed made large scale cost saving possible in many "
"organizations and for many years now.  The GNU/Linux operating system has "
"spearheaded this development.  Because of its free availability for download "
"was perceived in stark contrast to the expensive licenses of its main "
"competitor, Microsoft Windows.  For something as widely used and useful as "
"an operating system, the structural cost benefit of development cost put "
"onto many shoulders is undeniable.  Unfortunately the expectation that this "
"holds true for all Free Software products has led to the unrealistic view "
"that using it will always, immediately and greatly reduce cost. In our "
"experience, this is not true. As we have seen in earlier sections it does "
"make a lot of sense to get more out of the money spent using Free Software "
"and it is likely that over time and across multiple organizations money can "
"be saved, but for the individual agency looking to deploy a piece of Free "
"Software there will be an upfront investment and cost associated with "
"getting it to the point of maturity and robustness required."

"While this seems entirely reasonable to IT operations professionals it is "

"get Free Software in the door initially it can prove very challenging to "
"effectively manage expectations down the road. The earlier the true cost and "
"nature of the investment is made transparent to decision makers, the more "
"likely they are to commit to it for the long haul.  High value for money is "
"still attractive and a software services provider that will not continue to "
"be available because the high price pressure does not yield sufficient "
"economic success is as unattractive in Free Software as it is in proprietary "
"license based business models. It is thus also in the interest of the "

"any ownership claims to the software and prevent prices from being "

"generate profit.'' [Koot 03] or [Eng 10] claims that ``economists showed "
"that real world open source collaborations rely on many different incentives "
"such as education, signaling, and reputation.'' (without any mention of "
"economic incentives). This purely ``social'' view of FLOSS is biased and "

"The basic idea behind business models is quite simple: I have something or "
"can do something -- the ``value proposition'' -- and it is more economical "
"to pay me to do or get this ``something'' instead of doing it yourself "
"(sometimes it may even be impossible to find alternatives, as in natural or "
"man-made monopolies, so the idea of doing it myself may not be applicable).  "
"There are two possible sources for the value: a property (something that can "
"be transferred) and efficiency (something that is inherent in what the "
"company does, and how they do it). With Open Source, usually ``property'' is "
"non-exclusive (with the exception of what is called ``Open Core'', where "
"some part of the code is not open at all, and that will be covered later in "
"the article). Other examples of property are trademarks, patents, licenses "
"\\dots\\ anything that may be transferred to another entity through a "
"contract or legal transaction.  Efficiency is the ability to perform an "
"action with a lower cost (both tangible and intangible), and is something "
"that follows the specialization in a work area or appears thanks to a new "
"technology. Examples of the first are simply the decrease in time necessary "
"to perform an action when you increase your expertise in it; the first time "
"you install a complex system it may require a lot of effort, and this effort "
"is reduced the more experience you have with the tasks necessary to perform "
"the installation itself; examples of the second may be the introduction of a "
"tool that simplifies the process (for example, through image cloning) and it "
"introduces a huge discontinuity, a ``jump'' in the graph of efficiency "

"R\\&D cost sharing: A company or organization may need a new or improved "

"platform, used by Nokia on its Mobile Internet Devices (like the N810); "
"within Maemo, only 7.5\\% of the code is proprietary, with a reduction in "
"costs estimated around 228M\\$ (and a reduction in time-to-market of one "
"year). Another example is the Eclipse ecosystem, an integrated development "
"environment (IDE) originally released as Free Software by IBM and later "
"managed by the Eclipse Foundation. Many companies adopted Eclipse as a basis "
"for their own product, and this way reduced the overall cost of creating a "
"software product that provides in some way developer-oriented "
"functionality. There is a large number of companies, universities and "
"individuals that participate in the Eclipse ecosystem. As recently measured, "
"IBM contributes around 46\\% of the project, with individuals accounting for "
"25\\%, and a large number of companies like Oracle, Borland, Actuate and "

"savings in terms of software research and development of 36\\% through the "
"use of Free Software; this is, in itself, the largest actual ``market'' for "
"Free Software, as demonstrated by the fact that the majority of developers "
"are using at least some Free Software within their own code (56.2\\%, as "
"reported in [ED 05]). Another excellent example of ``coopetition'' among "
"companies is the WebKit project, the HTML rendering engine that is at the "
"basis of the Google Chrome browser, Apple Safari and is used in the majority "
"of mobile devices. In the project, after an initial 1 year delay, the number "

"FLOSS not only allows for sustainable, and even very large market presence "

"different models that are totally impossible with proprietary software. The "
"fact that FLOSS is a non-rival good also facilitates cooperation between "
"companies, both to increase the geographic base and to be able to engage "
"large scale contracts that may require multiple competencies, both "
"geographical (same product or service, different geographical areas); "
"``vertical'' (among products)  or ``horizontal'' (among activities). This "
