"If you think you have got too much to tell, you probably do. Attention spans "
"are not what they were way back when; distraction/failure is just a click "
"away.  Remember that you can always work in steps. Break up your story if "
"needed. Cut a lengthy press release and use supporting documentation such as "
"technical fact sheets and testimonial pages instead. The chunking principle "
"(``5 plus or minus two'') is something I continue to utilize again and "
"again. Create your own message release cycle, and reinforce your presence "
"regularly. Bring a FAQ; if there is a question that needs to be asked and is "
"not there, find the opportunity to bridge your message. Repetition breeds "
"familiarity. Progressively reinforcing your call to action is goodness."

"Sometimes you need to walk away. From a project, from an argument, from work "
"altogether. Give yourself a break and try to pace yourself; allow a day for "
"things to settle down and for you to get a chance to breathe. Whilst that is "
"usually not possible in a deadline-driven industry, it is something to aim "
"for.  The mad rush, non-stop emails, and continuous tweets often trigger "
"reactions for emergencies that do not exist. Put the project down, clear "
"your head, and come back with a fresh perspective. Step aside and regain "
"your life."
