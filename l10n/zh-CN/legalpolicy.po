"In 1999, while completing my doctoral thesis that focused on a classical "
"copyright topic, I was assessing the scope of moral rights. In this context "
"I spent a while pondering about the question of how moral rights of "
"programmers are safeguarded by the GPL, which allows others to modify their "
"programs. This is how I first got in contact with FOSS. At the time, "
"``free'' and ``open'' certainly had different meanings, but the difference "
"was not worth arguing about in the world I was living in. However, since I "
"was free to do what I was interested in and open to investigate new "
"copyright questions, I soon found out that the two words \\textit{do} have "
"something in common, that they are \\textit{different} and yet they are best "
"used together..."

"To name one example, the important question of what constitutes a "
"``derivative work'' according to the GPL determines how the software may be "
"licensed.  Everything that counts as derived from GPL-licensed software must "
"be distributed under the GPL. To assess whether a certain software is a "
"``derivative work'' or not requires profound technical understanding. The "
"interaction of program modules, linking, IPC, plugins, framework technology, "
"header files and so on determines, among other criteria, whether a program "
"is formally inseparable, which helps to determine whether it is derived from "
"another program or not."

"what FOSS might have in store for their companies or institutions. We also "

"The third thing a FOSS lawyer needs is knowledge about foreign "
"jurisdictions, at least a few, and the more the better. In order to construe "
"the different licenses, it is essential to be familiar with the perspective "
"of the people who have drafted it. In most cases the U.S. legal system is of "
"key importance. For example, the GPL was drafted with U.S. legal concepts in "
"mind. In the United States, ``distribution'' includes online distribution, "
"whereas under the German Copyright system there is a distinction between "
"offline and online distribution.  Licenses that have been drafted by lawyers "
"from the United States may thus be construed as including online "
"distribution, which might be relevant and helpful in court proceedings"

"\\noindent{}When I started to work in Free Software I was struck by the "
"perceived difference between the ``community'' and the ``business'' "
"stakeholders in this field.  The informal assertion often aired at the time "
"essentially proposed that there were developers interested in hacking and "
"there were commercial parties who would use their output in objectionable "
"ways if not closely monitored. It was a generally baseless assumption, and "
"almost entirely limited to parties who identified themselves as the "

"Despite being primarily associated with the community side of things, I "
"resisted the concept that there were two inherently hostile parties facing "
"each other down over the future of Free Software. It sounded too simple to "
"frame the dynamics of contribution, use and support as the interplay between "
"noble creators and devious freeloaders. Indeed, it sounded more like a "
"situation where complexity, change and uncertainty had lead to the creation "
"of simplistic narratives to provide comfort for parties moving out of their "
"comfort zone. I could feel the tension in the air, I could hear the "
"arguments at booths and in meetings, and I could observe the sharp comments "
"or blowing off of steam at conferences. But what did it all mean?"

"Whether we were talking about Free Software project contribution, project "
"management or license compliance, the relationships between stakeholders "
"were often accompanied by assumptions, lack of communication and negative "
"emotion.  This in turn lead to greater complexity and a corresponding "
"increase in the difficulty of making unified decisions or resolving issues. "
"I was aware that one of the biggest challenges was how to build bridges "
"between individuals, projects and businesses, a necessary step to ensure "

"This was probably a system shock to parties who had been doing Free Software "

"common interest, to challenge each other, and to cooperate inside carefully "
"delineated and predictable lines. Like stamp collecting, train spotting or "
"Star Trek, it was a place where detail-orientated people could converge, and "
"it had the additional benefit of providing broader feel-good social benefits "
"as an output.  It was not where the original contributors had expected to "

"The changes in Free Software all looked a little confusing at the time, but "

"Secondly, despite the inherent tendency of any power base to be "
"conservative, static engagement with a changing field will only result in "
"moving the opportunity for improvement from existing parties to third "
