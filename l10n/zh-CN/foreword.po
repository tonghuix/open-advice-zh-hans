"This is a book about community and technology. It is a book that represents "
"a collective effort, much like the technology we build together. And if this "
"is in fact your first encounter with our community, you may find it strange "
"to think of a community as the driving force behind technology. Isn't "
"technology built by large corporations? Actually, for us it is almost the "
"other way around."

"The authors in this book are all members of what you could label the "
"software freedom community. A group of people sharing the fundamental "
"experience that software is more empowering, more useful, more flexible, "
"more controllable, more just, more encompassing, more sustainable, more "
"efficient, more secure and ultimately just better when it comes with four "
"fundamental freedoms: to use, study, share and improve the software."

"And while there is now an increasing number of communities that have left "

"In fact, the Internet and the Free Software Community\\footnote{For me, Open "
"Source is one aspect of that community. This particular aspect articulated "
"itself in 1998, so quite some time after the Internet came about. But please "
"feel free to replace Free Software by Open Source in your head if that is "
"your preferred terminology.} were co-dependent developments. As the Internet "
"grew, our community could grow with it, but without the values and "
"technology of our community, I have no doubts that the Internet would not "
"have become the all-encompassing network that we now see enabling people and "
"groups around the world."

"Until today, our software runs most of the Internet, and you will know at "
"least some of it, such as Mozilla Firefox, OpenOffice.org, Linux, and "
"perhaps even GNOME or KDE. But our technology may also be hidden inside your "
"TV, your wireless router, your ATM, even your radio, security system or "
"battleships. It is literally everywhere."

"It was essential in enabling some of the large corporations that you know, "
"such as Google, Facebook, Twitter and others. None of these could have "
"achieved so much in such a short time if it were not for the power of "
"software freedom that allowed them to stand on the shoulders of those who "
"came before."

"But there are many smaller companies that live from, with, and for Free "
"Software, including my own, Kolab Systems. Active partaking in the community "
"in good faith and standing has become a critical success factor for all of "

"But it is important to understand that our community is \\textbf{not} anti-"
"commercial. We enjoy our work, and many of us have made it their profession "
"for their livelihood and mortgage. So when we say community, we mean "

"Yes, users. Even if you did not realize it or ``never signed up for no "

"And this is what sets us apart from the monoculture behemoths, the gated "

"Because this book contains important grains of that implicit knowledge which "
"we usually build and transfer inside our sub-communities that work on "
"different technologies. This knowledge typically trickles down from "
"experienced contributors to less experienced ones, which is why it seems "
"very obvious and natural to those socialized in our community."

"All the people writing in this book are such experienced contributors in "
