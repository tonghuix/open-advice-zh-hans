"I started out in my hairier days by producing one of the UK’s first Linux "

"(LUG) community. I went on to create my own LUG in Wolverhampton in the UK "
"and founded the Infopoint project to encourage LUGs to advocate Linux at "
"computer fairs across the UK. I then went on to contribute to the KDE "
"community, founded the KDE::Enterprise site, got the KDE Usability Study "
"going, and contributed to a few little apps here and there. I then founded "
"the PHP West Midlands user group and started also getting interested in "
"GNOME. I wrote a few apps (GNOME iRiver, XAMPP Control Panel, Lernid, Acire) "
"and also co-designed and wrote some code for a new simplified audio app "
"called Jokosher. Around this time I co-founded the LugRadio podcast which "
"would run for four years with over two million downloads and spawning five "
"live events in the UK and USA. At this time I also started work as an Open "
"Source consultant at the government-funded OpenAdvantage where I really got "
"a chance to cut my teeth in community and working with organizations across "
"the West Midlands to help them to move to Open Source. After a few years at "
"OpenAdvantage I moved on to join Canonical as the Ubuntu community manager "
